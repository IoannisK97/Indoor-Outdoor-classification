# Indoor-Outdoor-classification
This jupyter notebook includes python that classifies data from the GNSS Logger app using the Machine Learning library scikit. The classes are indoor, outdoor and the between state at the door. It needs data from the GNSS logger app powerd by Google. I followed all the steps including getting the data preprocessing them and vectorizing. At the end I can output the prediction for a given file for at time periods. Wrote it after some research at the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program internship at KIOS Research center of Excellence and Innovation during summer 2022.
